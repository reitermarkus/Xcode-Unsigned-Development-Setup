Preparing Xcode to Allow Building Unsigned iOS Applications
===========================================================

## Disable Code Signing Requirement

1. Navigate to __/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS#.#.sdk/__.
2. Open __SDKSettings.plist__.
3. Expand the section `DefaultProperties`.
4. Set the value of `CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED` to `NO`.
5. Set the value of `ENTITLEMENTS_REQUIRED` to `NO`.
6. Set the value of `AD_HOC_CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED` to `YES`.
7. Restart Xcode.

## Install Saurik's ldid utility

1. Open Xcode preferences and select the __Downloads__ tab.
2. Install the __Command Line Tools__.
3. Open Terminal and execute the following commands:
```applescript
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Git/
cd ~/Documents/Git/
git clone git://git.saurik.com/ldid.git
cd ldid
git submodule update --init
./make.sh
sudo cp ldid /usr/bin/
```

PS: You only have to install __ldid__ once.

## Building An Unsigned Application in Xcode
1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. In the Project Navigator, select the project.
3. In the __Code Signing__ section, select __Don't Code Sign__ for __Code Signing Identity__.
4. Set the Build Destination to __iOS Device__.
5. Build the application (âŒ˜-B).

## Upload the App manually to your iOS Device

Add Required SHA1 Hashes To Application Binary:
In the Xcode Project Navigator, expand the section "Products".
Right-click the application binary (HelloWorld.app) and select "Show In Finder".

Show In Finder

Copy the application binary to the desktop.
Open Terminal on the OSX system where the application was built.
Add the SHA1 hashes to the application binary:

```applescript
cd ~/Desktop/
ldid -S HelloWorld.app/HelloWorld
```
Copy Application To Device and Reload UI Cache:
Open Terminal on the OSX system where the application was built.
Change to the desktop directory where the application was copied and use the scp utility to copy the application to the device:
```applescript
cd ~/Desktop/
scp -r HelloWorld.app/ root@192.168.1.161:/Applications/
```
Connect to the device via SSH, login as the user 'mobile', rebuild the UI cache, and re-spring the device:
```applescript
ssh -l mobile 192.168.1.161
uicache
killall backboardd
```
Note: The backboardd process can be replaced with SpringBoard for iOS versions prior to 6.0. Using SpringBoard for iOS6+ will still work, but the screen will be dimmed. Pressing the power button once then waking the device back up will bring brightness back to the previous setting.

Note: The IP address shown in the above commands (192.168.1.161) should be replaced with the IP address of the iOS device being used. This can be obtained within the iOS Settings app by tapping the arrow icon next to the WiFi Access Point the device is connected to. Before running the above commands, OpenSSH must be installed and enabled on the device.

After performing the above steps, your application should now be visible on the device's SpringBoard. I have read that the ldid command and scp procedure can be added to a script so it's automatically performed every time a build is completed in Xcode. Once I figure out how to do this, the above guide will be revised.


## Prepare your iOS Device

1. Install __OpenSSH__, __Open__ and __CyDelete7__ from Cydia.
2. Set up up a private key to ssh into your iOS Device. [(How-to)](http://www.priyaontech.com/2012/01/ssh-into-your-jailbroken-idevice-without-a-password/)

PS: If it still asks for a password you might need to add the private key to your OS X Keychain like so:

```applescript
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_dsa
```

## Add a Build script to sign and sync App to iOS Device automatically

1. Open the __Build Phases__ tab of your project.
2. Add the following script.
3. Change the `IP` to your iPhone's IP address.
4. Change the `BUNDLE_ID` to your iPhone's bundle Identifier.

```applescript
#!/bin/sh

# Modify this to your device's IP address or .local address.
IP="iPhone.local"

# Verify that the build is not for a Simulator.
if [ "$NATIVE_ARCH" != "i386" ] && [ "$NATIVE_ARCH" != "x86_64" ]; then

  # Kill running instance and remove the app folder.
  ssh root@$IP "killall '${TARGETNAME}'; rm -rf '/Applications/${WRAPPER_NAME}'"

  # Self sign the build.
  ldid -S "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${WRAPPER_NAME}/${TARGETNAME}"

  # Copy app to device.
  scp -r "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${WRAPPER_NAME}" root@$IP:/Applications/

  # Clear UI cache to show app on homescreen.
  ssh root@$IP su -c uicache mobile

  # Open app.
  ssh root@$IP open `defaults read "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${INFOPLIST_PATH}" CFBundleIdentifier`

  # This part creates an OS X notification to let you know that the process is done.
  # You can get terminal-notifier from https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier.
  /Applications/terminal-notifier.app/Contents/MacOS/terminal-notifier -title "Build Complete" -message "${PROJECT_NAME} installed on ${IP}."
